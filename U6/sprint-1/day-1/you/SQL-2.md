Here are some operations might be done on the given cricket table:

1. get all the data from the table.
2. Filter the table based on specific conditions (e.g., runs scored above 100, player type as a batsman, etc.).
3. Sort the table based on different columns (e.g., runs scored, debut year, etc.).
4. Group the data based on a specific column (e.g., city, player type) and perform aggregations like sum, average, count, etc. on other columns.
5. Add a new column to the table (e.g., Batting Average calculated using runs scored and number of matches played).
6. Remove columns from the table that are not required for analysis.
7. Update the values of specific cells in the table (e.g., correcting a player's debut year).
8. Perform calculations on columns (e.g., calculating the total runs scored by all batsmen, finding the highest run scorer, etc.).
